## Summary

This code can be used for any future election. Per election, there would only be two modifications needed. The first one would be at the beininng, line 9, when we load the file with the data. This line will look different to attach the correct file. And the second change would be line 48 and 51 to match the columns with the correct catagory. That is if the files are formatted differently that the one provided for this election.
